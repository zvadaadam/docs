The **Project Plan** is living documentation SteerCode uses to track goals, constraints, and next steps. **Plan Mode** can update it; **Code Mode** uses it as guidance during implementation.

### What to include

- **Project guidelines**: priorities, trade-offs, and decision rules
- **User personas & jobs-to-be-done**
- **Design direction**: colors, type, layout rules, brand voice
- **Coding conventions**: naming, formatting, folder structure
- **Integrations & APIs**: links to docs, keys handling strategy
- **Security & compliance**: data handling, auth, PII constraints
- **Release plan**: milestones, acceptance criteria, test strategy

<Tip>
  Start small. A few clear bullets dramatically improve generations. Keep it
  fresh as your project evolves.

### How to work with the Plan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Plan tab">
    Review current goals, assumptions, and open tasks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add or edit instructions">
    Capture constraints, do/donâ€™t lists, and design notes in your own words.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Plan Mode to refine">
    Ask the AI to propose milestones or a step-by-step implementation plan. When
    ready, switch to **Code Mode** to execute.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The Plan is **not code**. It guides the coding agent and improves reliability
  across edits.
