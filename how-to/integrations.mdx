SteerCode integrates with services like **Supabase** to give your project a production-ready backend (database, auth, storage, realtime, serverless) while you design and refine the UI in one place.

<Info>
  You can ask SteerCode to set up integrations in **Plan Mode** (to outline and
  prepare) and then switch to **Code Mode** to implement. See{" "}
  <a href="/how-to/code-vs-plan-mode">Code vs Plan Mode</a>.
</Info>

## Supabase Integration

Supabase provides a hosted **PostgreSQL** database with **real-time** capabilities, **user authentication**, **file storage**, and **Edge Functions** (serverless). Connecting Supabase to your SteerCode project gives you a full backend without writing boilerplate or managing servers.

### What you get

- **Database (PostgreSQL)** – Store/query data with full SQL. SteerCode can propose schema and wire your UI.
- **Auth** – Email/password and social logins. SteerCode can scaffold login, signup, gating, and session checks.
- **Storage** – Upload images/files with URLs and access controls.
- **Realtime** – Stream live data changes for chat, dashboards, and collaboration.
- **Edge Functions** – Run custom backend logic (TypeScript/JavaScript) for webhooks, payments, AI calls, and schedulers.

<Tip>
  SteerCode unifies front-end and back-end setup. Describe the feature (“Add a
  feedback form and save responses”) and SteerCode will scaffold the UI and the
  Supabase schema/logic needed to power it.

## Connect Supabase to your project

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Supabase account and project">
Sign up at the Supabase website and create a project (free tier works well for development).
<Check>
You should have a Supabase organization and a project with a ready PostgreSQL database.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Open Integrations in SteerCode">
  In your project, open **Integrations → Connect Supabase**.
</Step>

<Step title="Authorize & select your Supabase project">
  Log into Supabase (if prompted), grant access, then **select an organization
  and project** to link.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for configuration">
SteerCode configures the connection automatically.
<Check>
You’ll see a confirmation in the UI when the connection is ready.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Both SteerCode and Supabase offer generous free tiers for development.
  Production usage may require paid plans for each service.
</Info>

## Add user authentication

### Email + password (basic)

1. In **Plan Mode**, ask: **“Add login (email/password) with Supabase and gate the dashboard.”**
2. Switch to **Code Mode** to implement the flows and screens.
3. Create test users in **Supabase → Authentication → Users** or via your app’s signup page.

<Tip>
  For local/testing, you can disable email confirmations in **Supabase →
  Authentication → Providers → Email**. Re-enable for production.
</Tip>

### Social logins (e.g., Google)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the provider in Supabase">
    Go to **Authentication → Providers** and turn on Google (or another
    provider). Add the OAuth Client ID/Secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask SteerCode to add the button">
    Prompt: **“Add ‘Sign in with Google’ to the login screen using Supabase
    auth.”** SteerCode updates the UI and wiring.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Verify redirect URLs and environment variables for each OAuth provider.
  Misconfigured redirects are a common failure point.
</Warning>
