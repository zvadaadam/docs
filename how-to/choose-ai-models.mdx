| Model                     | Provider  | Profile                      | Thinking/Reasoning           | Credit usage           |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **GPT-5**                 | OpenAI    | Most advanced coding model   | ✅ Deep multi-step reasoning | **Premium (credits)**  |
| **GPT-4.1**               | OpenAI    | Fast senior programmer       | –                            | **Premium (credits)**  |
| **GPT-4.1 mini**          | OpenAI    | Fast junior programmer       | –                            | **Basic (no credits)** |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash**      | Google    | Fast junior programmer       | –                            | **Basic (no credits)** |
| **Claude Sonnet 3.7 / 4** | Anthropic | Strong quality-speed balance | ✅                           | **Premium (credits)**  |

<Info>
  You may occasionally see **experimental / stealth models** (e.g., *Horizon
  Alpha*). Availability changes—watch our socials for announcements.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If you’re iterating rapidly or doing light edits, choose a **Basic** model to
  **avoid credit usage**. Switch to a **Premium** model for complex refactors,
  tricky bugs, or multi-step integrations.
</Tip>

### Quick guidance

- **Speed first** (UI copy, small edits, quick prompts): _GPT-4.1 mini_ or _Gemini Flash 2.0_
- **General coding** (features, refactors, tests): _GPT-4.1_ or _Claude Sonnet_
- **Hard tasks** (deep reasoning, multi-file migrations): _GPT-5_ or _Claude Opus_

<Warning>
  Thinking-enabled models (e.g., GPT-5, Sonnet/Opus) are slower and consume more
  credits. Use them when the extra reasoning matters.
</Warning>
