Free users default to **public** projects. Paying users can switch visibility to **private** at any time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Go to **Settings → General** in your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle visibility">
    Enable **Private Project** to restrict access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Public** projects can be viewed and remixed by anyone and may appear in
  **Discover**.

<Warning>
  Once a project has been public, copies may exist. Switching to private won’t
  retract content already shared.
</Warning>
