SteerCode builds native mobile apps using <a href="https://expo.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Expo</a> and <a href="https://reactnative.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React Native</a>.  
It’s also the **first mobile app that builds mobile apps**, so you can generate on the go.

### How it works

1. Open <a href="https://steercode.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">steercode.com</a> or download the iOS app  
2. Type (or voice-record) your app idea  
3. Click **Generate**

In a few minutes you’ll have a custom native app. Apps can access location, contacts, calendar, camera, photo library, notifications, gyroscope, steps, sensors, flashlight, battery info, on-device/remote AI features, and more.

<Tip>
When requesting hardware features, mention each capability (e.g., “camera capture with gallery permissions” and “background location updates”) so SteerCode scaffolds the correct permissions and flows.
