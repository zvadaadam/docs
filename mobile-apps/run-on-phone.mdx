<Tip>
  If nothing opens after scanning: make sure camera permissions are granted,
  your device has internet access, and you’re not blocking universal links.
</Tip>

<Info>
  - **iPhone**: The preview opens directly; some features may require accepting
  permission prompts. - **Android**: Install **Expo Go** from the Play Store to
  preview.
